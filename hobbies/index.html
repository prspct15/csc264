    <h1>Sim Racing</h1>
    <p>My absolute favourite hobby, ever?</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitch.tv/iRaceWithAPad">Twitch Channel</a></p>
        <p>This is a weird one. It dated back when I started to like racing in general, like F1 and all other
          motorsports.
          When quarantine started, I took my controller and start playing racing games. To my surprise, I was pretty
          fast,
          like pretty damn fast. So I started to race semi-competitively and eventually got the eyes of some people in
          the community.</p>
        <p>And until earlier this year they decided, "Lets just get him a wheel, he has potential", and here I am today
          with a shiny
          new wheel, which I absolutely love it. And with that too I am more dedicated and motivated in this field.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only recently I have dipped my toes into actual racing, well karting. It definitely is a different feel
          compared to
          the stationary seated sim environment. The G-forces pushing and pulling me all over the track is a unique
          experience
          that I am looking forward more of. Simultaneously too my respect for drivers have grown significantly. They
          are mad. Like mad mad.
