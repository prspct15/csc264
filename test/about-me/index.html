            <h1>Who is Adam? What is Adam? Why is Adam?</h1>
            <p>Hello! My name is Adam Fahim, better known as Adam (or Peanuts, Adoms, and so much more). I am a student
                in <a href="https://melaka.uitm.edu.my/index.php/en/kjm-campus"> Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Melaka
                    Campus Jasin.</a>
            </p>

            <p>As a Computer Science student, it's been more than a honour to be studying in a course that I have adored
                in
                a long, long time, dating back to 2009! Obstacles definitely got in the way in realising my dreams, but
                no one was able
                to put it at a <strong>halt</strong>. As Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United player) once said, with a
                rather broken English:
            </p>

            <p>Furthermore, it was always been a me thing where I would just push my boundaries, at times too much...
                <strong>Definitely</strong> not thinking of a motorcycle crash.</p>

            <p>Well, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kota_Damansara">Kota Damansara, PJ</a> is what I would call
                home. My favorite part about
                <b>Kota Damansara</b> is that the community always have each others back, which is quite a rare
                occurence for an urban area, which,
                by the way, is one of the most rapidly developing cities in Malaysia! Not just that, the neigbouring
                areas are plenty fun too.</p>

            <p>Since quarantine, <b>Melaka</b> has been a long lost friend to me. When I started studying in Jasin, I
                ever so slightly start to enjoy
                living there - it is surprisingly so much fun, especially with my accompanying friends. Unfortunately,
                since <b>COVID-19</b> hit, things,
                it never felt the same anymore. Here's a message to you Melaka: I miss you.</p>

            <h1>Questions..?</h1>

            <h2>What's your ideal future?</h2>
            <p>I am interested in profressionally sleeping..................... not. Of course not. No no no. But
                truthfully, I am looking forward into furthering my studies in the same field and
                hopefully I can find a work that fits my passion, because when it is one it feels like a fun activity
                rather than a chore. Oh, most preferably somewhere in the EU.
            </p>

            <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
            <img src="wheel.jpg" alt="Pure commitment." width=600px>
            <p>Oooh, there's plenty of them, and this ^ is definitely one. I just love sim racing so much
                that I made a dedicated <a href="../hobbies">Sim Racing</a> page explaining my love for the hobby. </p>


            <h2>If you were given an AUX cord, what would you blast?</h2>
            <p>Tough question. But if I had to choose one and only one, I would choose two, which is my OG "adomS"
                playlist and this one that I collaborate with my friends.
                Fret not, all of them are good, enjoyable music. If it is not, it would have not been on the
                playlist(s).
